0.  gif- 256 png-2^48(2^24 normally) jpg-2^24 bmp-2^32
1.  only gif supports animation
2.  lossy- file size compressed but image quality remains same. allows recovering original image again      lossless- file size and image quality both are reduced. data are permanently deleted.
3.  lossy-jpeg,gif(not so lossy as jpeg though)    lossless-png,bmp
4.  When the operating system erases a FAT file, two things occur. First, the system modifies the filename’s first character in the file’s directory entry to signal that the file
    has been deleted and that the directory entry can be recycled. Second, the system moves all of the file’s FAT clusters
    to the hard drive’s list of free clusters. The actual file data is never touched.
5.  To sanitize the disk properly, the disk blocks must be filled with Guttman patterns, degauss the disk or sabotage it.
6.  stdint.h is a header file in the C standard library introduced in the C99 standard library section 7.18 to allow programmers to write more portable code by providing a set of typedefs that specify exact-width integer types, together with the defined minimum and maximum allowable values for each type, using macros .
7.  uint8_t-8 bit unsigned integer unit16_t-16 bit unsigned int uint32_t-32 bit unsigned int32_t-32 bit signed
8.  byte-8bit word-16bit dword-32bit long-signed32bit
9.  the first 2 bytes of bitmap are ascii values of characters "B" & "M" i.e. 01000010 01001101 in hex 0x424D
10. bfsize is the total size of bitmap file while bisize is the size required by the bitmapinfoheader structure.
11. If biHeight is positive, the bitmap is a bottom-up DIB and its origin is the lower-left corner. If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB and its origin is the upper-left corner.
12. biBitCount gives the color depth (i.e. bits per pixel)
13. NULL might be returned while writing in a file if there is no permission for the executable to write on the disk or the filename entered is not valid.
14. there is 1 in fread because we are concerned with reading required information only once from the file into the structure.
15. if biWidth is 3, the padding will be (4-(3*3)%4)%4 = 3
16. fseek is used to seek the file indicator to desired position in the file.
17. SEEK_CUR is the current position of the file indicator(pointer).
18. Solved!!!
