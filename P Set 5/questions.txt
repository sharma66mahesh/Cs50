0.  a pneumoconiosis caused by inhalation of very fine silicate or quartz dust.
1.  getrusage() returns resource usage measures for its first arg into the second struct arg.
2.  there are many members of rusage struct, but we are only interested in two: struct timeval ru_utime -- user time AND struct timeval ru_stime -- kernel loading time
3.  we pass before and after structs by reference so that the getrusage() function can modify its two structs.
4.  HOW OUR PROGRAM WORKS::
    First of all, we load the dictionary into memory. Then we open the text whose words are to be spell-checked, and read each of its chars.
    For each char, we check 
    - if it is alphabetical, or an aphostrope that is a latter part of the word. If true, we append it to char array word. If the 
        length exceeds the max length, we reject the word and move on to the next word.
    - else if it is a number, we reject it and consume all its latter letters.
    - else if index > 0, we append '\0' to the char array word as we have read all the chars of the word, and update word count.
        Then we check if the read word is correctly spelled or not by calling function check(word).
5.  we preferred fgetc to fscanf cuz we need to check each char bytes as the length of words is a variable, rather than reading a
        block into a struct with some members.
6.  we used const in check and load cuz we don't want modification to the pointer arguments passed.
